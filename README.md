# @nakedjsx/plugin-asset-prism
Build-time code syntax highlighting using [Prism](https://prismjs.com).

The result can then be styled by adding the [Prism CSS theme](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/tree/master/themes) of your choice. 
This plugin comes with a theme that aims to be accessible and that supports both light and dark modes.

See the [documentation](https://nakedjsx.org/documentation/#plugins-@nakedjsx-plugin-asset-prism) for more information.
